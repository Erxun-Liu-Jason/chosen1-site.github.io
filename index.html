					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity means that the software and hardware of the data in the system and the network system are saved from being leaked, changed, or damaged by unexpected or vicious reasons. With a tried and continuous operation of the network service and the system can not be broken down. </p>
					<p>Network firewall technology is a particular interconnection network equipment, which is used to enhance the access control between networks, hinder the users of the outer network from iniquitously entering the internal network through the external network, access to the internal network resources, and protect the internal network operating environment. It checks packets transmitted between two or more networks, such as link patterns, according to inevitable security policies, to decide if the telecommunications between networks is allowed or not, and invigilators the working state of the network.</p>
					<p>At present, the firewall products mainly include fortress host, packet filter router,
						application layer gateway, circuit layer gateway, shielding host firewall, dual host, etc.
						Anti-virus software is definitely the most widely used security technology solution because the technology is the easiest to implement, but we all know is the main function of antivirus software antivirus, the function is very limited, can not fully meet the needs of network security, this way maybe can meet the needs of individuals or small businesses, but if individuals or businesses have the demand of electronic commerce, It can't be completely satisfied.
						</p>
					<p>Fortunately, with the continuous development of anti-virus software technology, the current mainstream anti-virus software can prevent the Trojan horse and other hacker programs. Other antivirus software developers also provide a software firewall, with a certain firewall function, to a certain extent can play the role of a hardware firewall, such as KV300, Golden Mountain firewall, Norton firewall, and so on.</p>
					<p>The security technology used in combination with firewall includes file encryption and digital signature technology, its purpose is to improve the security and confidentiality of information systems and data. One of the primary technical means to prevent secret data from being stolen, intercepted, or destroyed by outsiders. With the development of information technology, people be more and more concentrate on network security and information confidentiality.</p>
					<p>At present, in accretion to enhancing data security safeguard in law and management, countries have also taken estimates in hardware and software technology respectively. It promotes the continuous improvement of data encryption skills and physical protection skills. According to the different functions, file encryption and digital signature technology basically include data transmission, data storage, data integrity discrimination, and so on.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence technology will be the focus of the next round of technological revolution. With the rapid development of AI and other technologies, the resulting security problems are more of a priority for our network security industry. Similar to artificial intelligence technology, blockchain is also listed as an important emerging technology. In the current network security industry, its two sides are very obvious. In contrast, the network defense of blockchain is also recognized in the industry, and it is reported that it is the second line of defense in the network security industry. The ensuing blockchain security, ecological security, information security, etc., have also become more obvious and complex. Its regulation has lagged behind the pace of development and has caused numerous safety problems. Quantum technology is now also threatening the security of traditional encryption algorithms. Quantum communication and quantum computing are the two most widely used technologies in the field of network security, and they are most closely related to network security. 5G technology has officially entered the commercial stage, and its network security threats will also be derived from new security technologies. The Internet of Things has been a safe disaster area. The complementary and coordinated development of cloud computing, edge computing, and fog computing will also have an impact on the security industry.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity is important because the amount of data that governments, the military, corporations, monetary and iatrical organizations gather in, store, and process on computers and other devices are unprecedented. A significant part of this data could be serious information, whether literary property, monetary data, personal detail, or other types of data, where illegal employment or reveal can have negative results. Companies transfer sensitive data over networks or other equipment in the course of their business, and cybersecurity describes the discipline of defending that data and the systems used to process or store it. As the scale and complexity of cyber hacking increase, organizations and companies, peculiarly those reliable for protecting data related to national security, medical, or monetary archives, need to take action to secure their sensitive commerce and individual information. America's top intelligence staff have warned that cyber strikes and electronic espionage are the most serious intimidation to state security, eclipsing even terrorism.</p>
					<p>New technologies in the cybersecurity industry are either research in nature, national strategy, or market-driven. These three pieces should be the main source of driving force for new technologies in network security.</p>
					<p>In terms of the nature of research, the vulnerability research technologies and methods at the system level emerge in an endless stream. With the iteration of versions and the update of hardware technology, many new injection reverse methods and vulnerability mining technologies have emerged from the traditional Windows to iOS and Android.</p>
					<p>From the perspective of national strategy, cyberspace confrontation and interference between countries will promote security methods and countermeasures at all levels from terminals to networks to systems to tools, as well as new ideas and technologies such as DNS pollution, BGP hijacking, and software intrusion.</p>
					<p>Driven from the market, is the apparent compliance and forced to promote market-oriented domestic technical generation and development, compliance-driven from a full business chain from upstream to downstream, the technology is accurate for the security services technology, technology itself is not necessarily the security, the security of the code is most concerned about, market behavior is more meet compliance requirements, At the same time, as far as possible to their problems, so, from code static to business dynamic self-protection and other related to the user business, in the confrontation has been developing.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>While work-at-home attacks are not a new threat, it is only a matter of time before an attacker can infiltrate multiple, insecure home networks simultaneously, wreaking havoc on critical systems and services. It makes sense. With many employees using their home broadband connections for personal and work purposes, the scope for corporate attacks has increased considerably.</p>
					<p>Data reveals can contain economic information such as credit card numbers or bank account details, personal health detail, individually identifiable information, trade secrets, intellectual property. Other ways for data breach include unintentional, data breach, cloud breach, information breach.</p>
					<p>When we join a public Wi-Fi, we usually reveal the risk of stealing personal detail from an external source. For example, some hackers on the network are able to access our devices to grab our personal detail. They range from so-called "man-in-the-middle" attacks to attacks that create bogus Wi-Fi to collect data. In what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, the connection between a user and a Wi-Fi will be hackers broken to steal private information. While the fake Wi-Fi networks are ones that hackers create, they will look really alike to a reasonable connection.</p>
					<p>Those hackers have access to reasonable names for Wi-Fi networks that look like what a business network would connect. For example, when the actual name of the network is "Starbucks Guest," they may set a name like "Starbucks Guest."Hackers could use these networks to collect illegal data from those people who connect this connection.	</p>

					<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>The autonomous vehicle is a kind of intelligent vehicle, also known as a wheeled mobile robot. It mainly relies on the computer system in the car, to reach the target of driving without the driver.
						The autonomous vehicle is a smart vehicle that able to latches the road environment by the onboard sensing system, plans the driving guidelines by the computers, and controls the vehicle to reach the scheduled target. Like so much else, Autonomous driving is a process of gradual technological development. There are also different stages of Autonomous driving.
						</p>
					<p>Stage one: the auxiliary driving stage. adaptive cruise, Lane-keeping, and other support driving capabilities are the technologies that we have at this stage, however, the navigator still is the main operator.</p>
					<p>Stage two: semi-autonomous. At this stage, the autonomous vehicle already can project the process of going to the destination in the computer calculation, and it also could serve as a backup system to support during the driving. However, due to the restriction of regulations and laws and other factors, it still can not occur as the main part of the driving.</p>
					<p>Stage three: Full self-driving. Technology, law, cost, and other factors cease to influence the popularity of the opportunities, computer control system has been the driving subject, the driver could take charge of the operating system anytime.</p>
					<p>Concerning automatic parking, the cause of vehicle damage is not a recurrent road accident, but a minor bump caused by parking. Parking can be the least critical driving behavior, but it may still make everything messy. Although several automakers are adding rear-view cameras and accelerometers that scale the distance of objects around them and through onboard computers that able to display what's on the sides of the car however some drivers are still bumping their way into parking spaces.</p>
					<p>The autonomous parking system is a major milestone of autonomous vehicles. With this system, the car is able to look into its surroundings similar to a driver, work at the right moment and travel securely from stop 1 to stop 2. While the technology isn't yet fully hands-off and letting the car drive you home, it's the first step in that direction.</p>
					<p>Since DARPA's ALV project in the 1980s, the most popular self-driving techniques we've seen are studded with sensors and have a lidar mounted on top of them. The vehicle uses sensors to detect and three-dimensional scans of lidar to 'sense' the world around it, while the onboard controlling computer acts like a human brain to decide what to do. Google's Autonomous vehicles are a good sample of lidar exhibitions.</p>
					<p>Google is regarded as the earliest Internet giant to Interdisciplinary to carry out the examination and exploit of autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, depending on their own map and big data computing resources, they really contain a leading benefit in this field. Google's autonomous vehicles use a 64-bit 3D lidar provided by Velodyne to create a 3D map of their circumstance. Combined with Google's senior-fidelity maps, Google's self-driving car uses a computer and a cloud network to process big data. Finally, realize the automatic driving function:</p>
					<p>Early test vehicles of the Toyota Prius were furnished with position sensors, range-ranging radar, video cameras, and lidar. Video cameras are used to estimate any traveling targets and traffic lights. LiDAR is also used to make 3D maps of actual highway conditions; Ranging radar is used to explore barriers on sides of the car. When a target approaches, the computer will voluntarily decrease the speed of the vehicle. The location transducer located on the left rear wheel detects and estimates the lateral deviation of the car to condition its position on the map.</p>
					<p>After years of efforts, Google has publicity its demo Autonomous vehicle. The sample is also loaded with radar and transducers, as much as a lidar installed on the top of the vehicle. Google's Autonomous vehicle, which has removed the steering wheel and is drive completely by an onboard computer, is the optimal thing even to an Autonomous car concept.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Professional drivers will be drastically reduced. Autonomous cars will reduce the need for truck drivers, taxi drivers, and other professional drivers. The human cost of large bus and truck drivers is not a small expenditure, and can not let each driver work too hard, work too long, to avoid the bad consequences of fatigue driving, and unmanned driving can be very good to alleviate or even solve this problem.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars have reduced the traffic accident rate. There are statistics show that 1,200,000 person die every single year from all over the world automotive or related to traffic accidents, of which 93% is caused by human error, and unmanned vehicles using on-board sensors to the surrounding environment, and according to the perceived position of road vehicles and obstacles of information control steering and speed of the vehicle, the vehicle on the road can safely and reliably and It can reduce the number of road accidents caused by careless mistakes and reduce the number of people killed.</p>
					<p>In many American cities, however, there are concerns that the development of autonomous driving will ruin their economies. These cities rely on revenue from car use to balance their budgets, which can amount to 15 to 50 percent of their city's transportation revenue: gasoline taxes, vehicle registration fees, and billions of dollars in parking revenue. But Autonomous cars do not incur these costs, and the city's finances will be in a large deficit. If the government is asked to bear the cost, it will certainly affect the investment in other public services. Therefore, they call on the government to stop the deployment of Autonomous cars. Others worry that, contrary to the large number of jobs created by Uber, Autonomous cars may make many newly paid drivers lose their jobs.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>Autonomous cars free up hands and save more personal time. With time not wasted driving, waiting for traffic lights, or looking for a parking space, we can use the extra commute time to check email, grab a coffee, take a nap, or video chat with a friend far away. Women can wake up later and move makeup and breakfast time to the car.</p>
					<p>No more worrying about look for a car park. The proliferation of Autonomous cars means we won't have to search for a parking space, as they will drive themselves to find the perfect spot after delivering us to our destination. Even if we buy an Autonomous car, we don't need to park because it can find a spot and park itself. This will alleviate the shortage of parking spaces in the city to a large extent.</p>
					<p>The private car may be on its way out. When the entire unmanned driving technology has been mature and applied to the public transport system, all the traffic will be uniformly scheduled in a system. When you need a car, the system will allocate the nearest car to pick you up at intervals. It is similar to the sharing concept of Uber. When you need a car, a shared Autonomous car will come to help you complete the travel request. For example, after you buy the weekend groceries, the Autonomous car that just sent you home will pick up the elderly people next door to the hospital immediately.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars are used to shuttle children to various extracurricular activities after school. The car is equipped with monitors that allow parents to keep an eye on their children. Parents may prefer Autonomous cars to strangers picking up and dropping off their children.</p>
					<p>Autonomous cars have also appeared, with the main benefit of making roads safer. People who are elderly or unable to drive could also benefit from Autonomous cars.</p>

					<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Technological innovation is the fundamental driving force of economic growth. The most important thing of these technologies is what economists refer to as "general-purpose technologies" such as the internal combustion engine, the steam engine, electricity, and so on. Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly the most important "general-purpose technology" of our era. Especially the combination of artificial intelligence and industry has released the potential of the industry and change our lives.</p>
					<p>"Machine learning" is the most important driving force behind the revolutionary advances in the field of artificial intelligence that has received so much attention.</p>
					<p>Machine learning is an interdisciplinary subject, which involves decision theory, algorithm complexity theory, experimental science, function approximation theory, optimization theory, cybernetics, computer science, probability statistics, and other disciplines. Therefore, there are many different definitions of machine learning, each of which is defined from the perspective of related disciplines. But in general, the core issue of its concern is how to simulate human-like learning behavior computationally: to take the rules (or models) from historical experience and apply them to new and similar scenarios.</p>
					<p>Decision trees and their variants are algorithms that divide the input area into many different regions, and each region has its independent parameters. The decision tree algorithm makes the best of the tree model, the root node to a leaf node is a separate classification of the path rules, each leaf node represents an independent judgment category. The samples are first divided into different parts, and then the segmentation recursion is executed until each subset gets samples of the same type. The prediction category can be gotten by starting the test from the root node to the subtree and then to the leaf node. This method has a simple structure and high efficiency of data processing.</p>
					<p>An artificial neural network is similar to an unusually complex network of neurons, consisting of individual interconnected units, each of which has a numerical input and output, either in the form of a real number or a linear combination function. It has to learn in a discipline of learning before it can work. When a network makes a wrong judgment, it can learn to make it less likely to make the same mistake. This method has strong generalization ability and nonlinear mapping ability and can model the system with little information. From the point of view of functional simulation, it has parallelism, and the speed of information transmission is extremely fast.</p>
					<p>In the process of machine learning, parameter estimation methods such as maximum likelihood estimation are needed. In the case of potential variables, the EM algorithm is usually chosen, which does not directly estimate the maximum of the function object but adds some data for simplified calculation and then carries out maximization simulation. It is a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm for data that are limited by the experience or difficult to be processed directly in the field of machine learning, deep learning is a recent research direction, which is presented into machine learning to achieve it closer to the initial target artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
					<p>The purpose of deep learning is to study the inherent rules and representation steps of a sample target, and the information captured during the process of studying is a benefit for helping the explanation of data such as words, graphs, and voice. The final aim is for machines to be as thinking and studying as real humans, can identify those data are collected such as texts, photos, and voices. Deep learning is a sophisticated machine learning arithmetic that has far overcome antecedent technologies in voice and graph identification.</p>
					<p>Deep learning has already achieved several efforts in search skills, natural language processing, machine learning, multimedia learning, data mining, machine translation, individuation technologies, big data analysis, and recommendation, voice identifies, and other related fields. Deep learning empowers machines to simulate human activities such as audio-visual and make choice, settles several hard pattern identification issues, and realizes significantly improvement in artificial intelligence-related technologies.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>The IT giants are deeply studying and applying machine learning, aiming to fully imitate the human brain, in an attempt to create machine brains with human intelligence.</p>
					<p>In 2012, Google issued epochal manufacture in the area of artificial intelligence, a demic brain emulation software with self-learning abilities. Emulation brain cell communication and learn to recognize dogs, humans, and other kinds of stuff by observing YouTube videos. When data is passed to this neural network, the connections between different neurons influence. This also affords the neural network to learn how to react to some data. The connection is knowing to have learned something, and Google is anticipated to utilize the ultramodern technology in several fields, with speech identification likely to benefit first.</p>
					<p>As genomes and other sorting programs run on to expand, the center of bioinformatics research is removaling from backlogging information to enplaning it. after a short while, discoveries in biology will rely quite on our analytical capacity to combine and correlate varying data across multiple magnitudes and at different scales, instead of just sustained to concern on conventional areas. order data will be comprehensive with configuration and functional data on gene utterance, biochemical mechanism data on phenotype, and clinical data. With such a significant number of data, there is an emergency need for the improvement of academic arithmetic and software in the repository, procurement, processing, look through, and imagery of biological information. on the side, because of the sophistication of genome data itself, there is an emergency necessity for the improvement of academic arithmetic and software. nevertheless, machine learning methods such as genetic algorithms neural networks, neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees are appropriate for behavior with such areas with a significant number of data, noise, and lack of unified theory.</p>
					
					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>You can use spoken commands to ask the phone to perform tasks such as searching or making calls, and these functions rely on machine learning. Virtual personal assistants such as Siri, Alexa,  and Google Assistant are all able to follow spoken commands because they recognize speech. They can process natural human language and match it with expected instructions and responses in increasingly natural ways. These intelligent assistants can learn a lot of conversations in different ways. They can be asked for specific information, such as how to read your name or identify the owner of a voice in a room. A large number of conversations from the users they use become sample data to help an intelligent assistant identify words that sound different, or how to create a natural discussion.</p>
					<p>Many of us are already familiar with shopping recommendations, such as supermarkets reminding you to add cheese to an online store or Amazon suggesting books you might like. Machine learning allows Amazon to offer recommendations to individual shoppers through what's called a recommendation system. By analyzing users' previous shopping data and various preference expressions, the recommendation system can record users' purchasing history patterns. They use this model to predict what you're likely to buy.</p>
					<p>Machine learning can also be used to distinguish between different labels of items or objects. Artificial intelligence is playing an important role in filtering out spam emails. This technique is especially beneficial for sorting out the emails you ask from the ones you don't want to read. Spam discovery systems can use sample mail to filter spam and identify spam by finding specific words, names of specific senders, or other characteristics. Using this learning ability, these systems can straight link email messages to the correct folders. It can also mark emails like a user, or move between folders.</p>

					<h3>Natural language processing and chatterbots</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics and artificial intelligence, particularly contributed to help computer understand, process and manipulate the statements and words in human language. In other words, natural language processing is the technology that program computers to answer questions the way humans do and allow them to give appropriate response, for example Siri and Alexa. These artificial intelligences can be classified as chatterbots. Chatterbots refer to computer science which generate automated responses to human’s inputs through conversation and written words. Importantly, chatterbots are depended on natural language processing. With NLP, chatterbots can learn to read, decipher, and interpret human written and spoken language and create narratives that describe, summarize, or interpret input (structured data) in a human-like manner. NLP is the driving force behind many of the AI solutions that users frequently interact with and enables understanding between humans and machines.</p>
					<p>So far, Natural Language Processing is booming in the best time in its history, as the technology continues to advance and integrate with various industries and implementations. The latest report showed that the market value of NLP achieved at USD 10.72 billion in 2021, predicting that it will be reached at about 48 billion in the next ten years (Natural Language Processing (NLP) Market | Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026), 2021). As humanity enters the age of intelligence, with unprecedented growth in smart devices and data volumes, the demand for human-computer interaction through speech and language is growing exponentially, and more influential cutting-edge research and technology innovations will emerge in the field of speech and natural language processing.</p>
					<p>Machine translate is the most fundamental application which interacted with natural language. It automatically translate text or speech from foreign language to native language. The traditional rules of process is based on the blending of language, grammar and related dictionaries. According to Devura and Jain (2020, p.3), until 2020, about a quarter of all enterprises have applied chatterbots processed by NLP into their customer services. It implies an importance and comprehensive use of chatterbots based on NLP in recent decades. Siri system is regarded as a typical representative of chatterbots. It is a dialogue system which is able to understand human language and return a response. </p>
					<p>The future trend of natural language processing is the deep integration of NLP with many fields, thus creating value for various related industries. The need for natural language processing is increasing in fields such as banking, electrical appliances and medicine. The closer NLP is integrated with various industries, the stronger the trend of specialized services will be In the field of medical and health care, natural language processing technology has a broad application prospect, such as the auxiliary entry of medical records, medical data retrieval and analysis, and auxiliary diagnosis, etc. Modern medical information is vast, and new medical methods and approaches are developing rapidly. No doctor or specialist can master all the medical developments, and natural language processing can help doctors quickly and accurately find the recent research progress of various difficult diseases, so that patients can enjoy the fruits of medical technology progress as soon as possible.
						Although the NLP technology has already applied in retrieving and extracting clinical information, it is also restricted and inadequate. Nadkari et.al. (2011) proposed that the medical NLP requires more precise understanding of terminology. This brings it back to the biggest challenge that NLP is facing, which is language ambiguity. Word sense disambiguation also requires a proper understanding of the textual context, conversational environment, and background information, which cannot be clearly modeled yet. These factors all contribute to the difficulties in NLP implementation. You must have access to large amounts of natural language data so that computers can interact extensively. Serving these interactions and bridging the gap between binary language and natural language, computational power is critical.
						</p>
					
					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Natural language processing plays an important role in all walks of life. It has been widely used in many businesses of customers in industries such as e-commerce, finance, logistics, healthcare, and culture and entertainment. It can help users build intelligent products such as content search, content recommendation, opinion recognition and analysis, text structuring, and dialogue bots, and is also able to customize personalized solutions through cooperation. On the one hand, the huge amount of information can provide more "materials" for computers to learn natural language; on the other hand, it also provides a broader application arena for NLP. For example, as an important application of NLP, search engines have gradually become an important tool for people to obtain information, and there are search engine giants represented by Google, Baidu, etc.; machine translation has also come from the laboratory to the common people; NLP-based Chinese input methods (such as Sogou, Microsoft, Google, etc.) have become essential tools for computer users; computers and cell phones with speech recognition are also gaining popularity The NLP-based Chinese input methods (such as Sogou, Microsoft and Google) have become essential tools for computer users. In terms of application, intelligent chatterbots are actually designed to cope with the information overload. After the users ask the question to the dialogue system in natural language, chatterbots can answer the question precisely and smoothly. Up to now, chatterbots are able to replace a large number of human customer service agent in all industries for simple technical problems and customer support.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>There are many scenarios in which NLP can be used. It enables machines to perform repetitive tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans, thus helping to scale up language-related tasks. With the explosive development of e-commerce, NLP plays an important role in the search result query. It helps to identify key words in order to acquire relevant information. Basically, when users entered products’ details into search box in Amazon, it fruitfully targets the exact products which save much time shopping for things outside. Additionally, NLP enables AI to communicate with people about everyday problems and matters, freeing up more time for humans to do higher-level strategic work. Based on the application scenarios of chatbots, there are 3 main types of chatbots. Question-answer system is usually used in home appliance control in smart home which makes human life more convenient and safer. A Dialogue System is usually oriented towards a task where the robot needs to interact with the user, even for multiple rounds. Finally, business resources need to be invoked to complete a task. For example, a bot that checks the weather. Casual chat is a kind of open domain chatting scenario, just like chatting between two friends without restricting the topic and content. Chatty bots are mainly used for personal assistants, entertainment and other scenarios, with typical representatives such as Microsoft Ice and Apple Siri.</p>

						Problem needs to be solved
					</h1>
					<p> 
						In present days, the main problem has become to have access to 
						food during the pandemic of Covid 19. At this point, people are 
						struggling between the second wave of COVID-19 where citizens 
						are being more cautious about stepping out of their house. While
						people are maintaining social distancing by a large extent, 
						there are certain cases where people are needed to go outside 
						to acquire food. At that point of time, they can be in contact 
						with this virus. In this case, the global economy is deteriorating 
						significantly and restaurant industry in the country of Australia 
						is facing a great loss. Therefore it is the responsibility of Australians 
						to save its economy. In this proper solution to this problem is needed.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Overview
					</h1>
					<p>
						In order to recover from this situation, smartphone applications for food 
						ordering can be developed through which the restaurant can update its 
						traditional menu ordering system with a smart menu ordering system 
						(Cha and Seo, 2020). In this manner, the users or the guests who 
						are coming to the restaurant do not have to touch their mem card which 
						can contain COVID virus. At this point, this application can assist the 
						restaurants to embrace zero-contact service to people of Australia for 
						combatting this deadly pandemic. 
					</p>
					<h1>
						Motivation 
					</h1>
					<p>
						It is fortunate that Australia country is one the verge of being in a better 
						position, whereas the other countries are facing the second wave. At this 
						point, people of this country still need to take precautions carefully in 
						order to avoid the extensive spread of this pandemic. At this point, digital 
						innovation is that particular aspect which can assist people in maintaining 
						social distance from each other. In this regard, digital menu ordering systems 
						can help them in adhering to co contact principles throughout the pandemic. 
						In addition to this, people can take control of their activities while going 
						out to any restaurants.  
					</p>
					<h1>
						Target market
					</h1>
					<p>
						After severe consequences of COVID-19, people have started going out again. 
						In this case, the main target market for this application is mostly people 
						of Australia who are eager to eat any restaurant while following precautionary 
						measures for obstructing the spread of COVID-19. Under the circumstances, place 
						demographic attributes can be considered as the main target since people of 
						any age and employment status or any other aspects can come to restaurants. 
						In addition to this, the other customer  group can be identified as a target 
						market who have a smartphone. Since the entire project revolves around smartphones, 
						so people of Australia with smartphones can be a greater target market for 
						this application.   
					</p>
					<h1>
						Technical specification 
					</h1>
					<h4>
						Hardware requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						There are external hardware devices can be utilized in this proposed application. 
						Two mobile phones and a computer must be used for the proceeding of this application 
						related to the restaurant menu ordering system. Each of the devices should be immune 
						to COVID-19 spread and proper caution must be used while operating these devices. 
						The smartphones will be used for two end user requirements (core.ac.uk, 2021). The 
						first one can be used by the users or the guests who will be coming to the restaurants.  
						And, the other one will be used from the restaurant side in order to take orders and 
						other attributes. In this case, computer system will be used as one back end server 
						which can store the application databases and back-end program of the application. 
						Therefore, it is mandatory that the information will be stored only in the computer 
						server not in those two smartphones. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Software requirements 
					</h4>
					<p>
						For designing the interface of this ordering application, MIT App Inventor can be used. 
						Certain development languages are required for designing the background program for this 
						application. In this case, python or java can be effective. APII interface design along 
						with database applications, database software libraries such as SQLite must be utilized 
						for backend programming of this menu ordering application. Python can be used for managing 
						databases including storing user information (Bhargave et al., 2013). For this advanced 
						application, user information can include user details, login credentials, restaurant 
						menus and so on. Furthermore, encryption mechanisms must be used for encrypting personal 
						information of users along with password encryption. In this regard, RSA algorithm can be 
						used for the effectiveness of this application. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Skill requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						Extensive knowledge about programming languages such as python or java  must be acquired 
						for developing source code for this menu ordering  application for restaurants. Furthermore, 
						several aspects of API and database management system plus query language must be known for 
						proper development of this application. In case of API, the functions of an API such as Google 
						Map API must be known for designing this independently. Database management system knowledge 
						can help in carrying out  activities related to database engines such as SQLite. Encryption 
						technologies should also be covered for encrypting personal user information for this application.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Description 
					</h1>
					<h4>
						User application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						Initially user registration or user login page must be developed so that users can have access to 
						their individual private account for the restaurants. For this, user information like user name, 
						address, phone number must be put into the system. Although these private information are collected, 
						the data will be stored in a database server through encryption technology for security purposes. 
						If the user is frequent in any restaurant then the user preference will also be stored along with 
						recommended menu items making it easy for the users to order (Patil et al., 2017). After selecting 
						the restaurant they have gone to, they can see dinning time, number of people who are dining in so 
						that they can make a choice of whether they desire to eat  at that restaurant or not. Customer rating 
						facilities must be added  in this application for other customers to know about the protocols of 
						restaurants. Since, there can be several restaurants, a particular sort index must be added which 
						can show a range of restaurants based on service rank, business hours, score and current distance. 
						In case the users need assistance during their meal they can also call waiter from the waiter service 
						function designed for providing real time communication facilities.

					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">(Source: irjet.net, 2021)</p>
					<h4>
						Restaurant side application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						From restaurant side application, the login interface must be designed for the restaurants. Logging 
						into their personal accounts, restaurants can edit its contact number, address, number of people currently 
						dining, maximum number of people, business hours, menu orders and additional information (iaetsdjaras, 2021). 
						Through Google Map API the restaurants can add their address and directions to get their. Additionally, restaurants 
						can display its introduction along with its signature dishes, the number of customers who are in line and the 
						hygiene protocols followed by the restaurants for the customers who are inclined towards avoiding contact with 
						anyone. Menu options can present options based on different filters and sorting procedures such as lower price 
						first or higher price first. Furthermore for frequent customers their previously ordered items can additionally 
						be present there. Dishes ordering based on different flavors can also be generated for accessibility of customers. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Payment application
					</h4>
					<p>
						Online payment application modules can reduce human touch to a large extent because of cashless transactions. 
						In payment application, relevant API functionalities of banks must be obtained. At this point, bank details 
						of the users must be collected for initiating transactions (Li et al., 2020). After completing the transaction 
						from the bank side, an automated bill must be generated. This bill information will be stored by both 
						customer end and restaurant end.      
					</p>
					<h1>
						Outcome
					</h1>
					<p>
						This developed smartphone restaurant menu ordering system can improve the traditional ordering system which is prone 
						to human contact because of high dependence upon paper based processes (Munene and Kasamani, 2018). The concerned 
						solution can assist the customers in ordering their foods at any restaurants at their basic comfort while reducing 
						human contact due to transaction bills, menu cards and other aspects. Furthermore the customers can be able to know 
						about restaurants’ current business timing, customer gatherings in order to avoid larger gatherings which can spread 
						COVID 19. The implementation technologies such as DBMS, SQLite, Python, Java and API can provide technical advancement 
						to menu ordering systems which can follow the basic rule of COVID19 precaution such as social distancing. Therefore, 
						it can be conjectured that this application can provide customers who are particularly concerned about their restaurant 
						choices during this pandemic. Therefore the safety ratings, business conditions and other attributes can assist customers 
						in making suitable restaurant choices.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Feasibility of project
					</h1>
					<p>
						This menu ordering application can attest to development of current customer trends towards, real-time and convenient 
						technological innovation. In this case, the menu ordering system through smartphones can substitute the utilization of paper 
						which is inconvenient and critical in present COVID 19 circumstances (Aulia et al., 2017). Through this application, both 
						customers and restaurants can be benefited in their respective context such as dining in a safe restaurant and improving 
						business productivity.
